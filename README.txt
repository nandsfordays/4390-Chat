Project folder includes Server and Client projects. Run the Server first and input
an integer between 50,000 and 60,000 for port number. Then, enter same number on
Client side. After this, messages can be exchanged freely. To end communication, 
type ".over" into either Server or Client and send. Connection will terminate.
